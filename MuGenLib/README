MuGen is a library that implements a comprehensive approach to Bayesian inference of multi-trait models for quantitative genetics.  It enables genome-wide association 
studies and genome-enabled prediction, allows for complicated and unbalanced experimental designs, outlier observations, and missing data.  Internal implementation is
multithreaded and uses GNU Scientific Library and BLAS for computation.  These computational details are hidden behind the interface which is designed for users familiar 
with basic C++ programming.
